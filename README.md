## Hi, I'm Bryce 

Los Angeles-based video engineer with extensive experience in live event production, broadcast studio technology, and automation. I have experience blending hands-on production expertise with custom software development to deliver efficient, innovative solutions across broadcast and live media workflows.

## üåê Open Source Work
I'm a regular contributor to [Bitfocus Companion](https://bitfocus.io/companion), an open source broadcast automation software that is widely used throughout the A/V and broadcast industry. I actively maintain Companion plugins that tens of thousands of users rely on for graphics playback control, recording system monitoring, remote guest management, and streaming control.

If you'd like to support my open source work, the best way is with a GitHub sponsorship.

## üí∏ Freelance

I'm available for freelance projects in the production automation realm. I've worked with leading companies in the broadcast software industry to enhance their automation offerings. Some high-level examples include:
- Built an easy-to-use, calendar based scheduling tool for an ingest system
- Developed a comprehensive shotbox control solution for a cloud-based remote production product
- Created control plugins for a remote guest platform, and provided input to enhance their existing API offerings

I'm knowledgable with Javascript, Typescript, NodeJS, Python, and creating simple, reliable solutions for complex problems.

If you think I'd be a good fit for a project, [drop me an email](mailto:contact@bryce.fyi) and we can chat.
